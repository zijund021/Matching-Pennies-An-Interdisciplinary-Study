### üåç Global Frontier Reflection ###
## üí¨ Comparative Reflection ##
At AWS, we saw frontier tools like Vast Tripo 3D, Shushu‚Äôs data solutions, and Twitch analytics, showing how US firms emphasize openness, scalability, and global developer ecosystems. Tencent, through social platforms and models like IMA and Hunyuan, revealed a more integrated, domestic-focused approach where regulation and data sovereignty strongly shape innovation.

Computational game theory holds promise: It can optimize platform competition, improve ad pricing, and enhance user engagement in games like Tacticool. However, its peril lies in reinforcing monopoly power, exploiting behavioral biases, and amplifying inequality when algorithms are opaque.

Convergence appears in both the US and China adopting AI-driven personalization and performance-based optimization. Divergence emerges in governance: The US platforms emphasize market-driven experimentation and global outreach, while the Chinese platforms align closely with state policy and prioritize data control. For the SDGs, these technologies can reduce inequality (SDG 10) and strengthen institutions (SDG 16), but only if ethical safeguards are embedded.

##  üí¨ Liberal Arts & Global Leadership ##
‚ÄúHow can we together do better?‚Äù By balancing innovation with responsibility. Liberal arts training‚Äîcritical reflection, interdisciplinarity, and ethical reasoning‚Äîequips us to question how technologies like computational models are used, not just how they work.

At DKU, the joint model is itself an experiment in collaboration: East-West faculty teach side by side, combining economics, computer science, and ethics. For example, in classes on game theory or AI policy, we analyze not only the algorithms but also their social consequences in China and the U.S. This environment trains students to compare AWS‚Äôs open, global platforms with Tencent‚Äôs regulated, domestic ecosystems, and to design models mindful of both.

Such cross-cultural, interdisciplinary practice fosters leaders who can bridge technical expertise with social awareness. Responsible innovation in computational economics thus becomes not only about efficiency, but about building empathy, governance, and inclusive progress.
